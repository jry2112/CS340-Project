# Tech School Management Database

## Overview
Tech School serves 100 students a year. They need a database that tracks students,
courses, instructors, and payments. Additionally, student balances need to be retrieved and
updated with payments processed via one of 4 methods (Cash, Credit/Debit, Check, and Wire) or
with the tuition cost of enrollment into one or more classes. Tech School expects to process
1,000 payments and have around 250 enrollments. Student balances are expected to be less than
20 thousand dollars as students who join the technical school also work either full time or part
time and usually enroll in just one class per semester. A database-driven website will keep
record of all students, which courses students are and were previously enrolled in, courses
offered, and the student account balance (payments received and balance still owed).
